I am a master’s student in Computer Science at Stanford University. In June 2025, I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I graduated with departmental honors.

My research interests are in computer architecture, compilers, and the design of hardware–software systems for high-performance computing and machine learning.
